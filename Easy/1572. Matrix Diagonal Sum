# 1572. Matrix Diagonal Sum
# 
# Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.
# Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the 
# elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
#               [4,5,6],
#               [7,8,9]]
# Output: 25
# Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
# Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
#               [1,1,1,1],
#               [1,1,1,1],
#               [1,1,1,1]]
# Output: 8
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: mat = [[5]]
# Output: 5
